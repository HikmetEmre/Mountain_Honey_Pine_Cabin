# Pine Cabin – Interactive 3D Scene (Three.js) #

A small interactive 3D environment built with Three.js (ES Modules).  
Focus: camera navigation ergonomics, object placement workflow, light/audio atmosphere, and a clean “walk around the scene” experience.

# What it demonstrates #
- GLB scene loading (terrain + props) using
- User-friendly navigation (mouse-look + keyboard movement)
- Terrain-following camera height to prevent clipping under the ground
- Positional + ambient audio (forest/wind global, bees positional)
- Lightweight UI overlay (product info popup)
- Scene state save/load (localStorage) + JSON export

# Controls #
- Mouse: look around
- W/A/S/D: move
- Space: up (if enabled)
- Shift: down (if enabled)
